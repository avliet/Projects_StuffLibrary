Description: 
This project will create a peer to peer repository of "things" in order to enable group ownership and collaborative consumption within private groups or even society at large.

Rational:
Our current society is geared, in part, towards individuals or groups purchasing the specific objects and tools they require for their specific needs.  What ends up happening is that we create a society where each person or group acquires a set of tools that they may use only briefly, then never use again, or use only rarely.  The effort and energy put into creating, transporting, acquiring, and storing that tool becomes in effect "dead" effort, "dead" energy.  

Solution:
Enter; collaborative consumption.  http://wikipedia.org/en/collaborative_consumption
